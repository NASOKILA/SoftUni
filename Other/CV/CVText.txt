My name is Atanas, currently working as a Software Engineer in an agile team of 5 people in United Kingdom.

I offer 1 year of professional experience for J Sainsbury's in West Midlands UK and 2 additional years of hands-on experience on projects from a private university.

I am looking for an opportunity in Switzerland as I am about to reallocate there soon.

The technologies I am working with at the moment are C#, JavaScript, .Net Core, REST, SOAP XML, JSON, Reactjs + Redux, HTML5, CSS3, Less & Sass, Microservice architecture, DevOps, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes and more. 

I also have experience in Angular and Node.js + Express.js and more.
