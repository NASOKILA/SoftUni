                The Force Awakens was announced after the Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. It was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films The Empire Strikes Bak (1980), rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous six films, returned to compose the film's score.
